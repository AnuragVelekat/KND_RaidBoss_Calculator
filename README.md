# Knights and Dragons Raid Boss Simulator

A web application that simulates raid boss battles in the mobile game **Knights and Dragons**. This app calculates damage output and estimates resource (energy and gem) requirements needed to reach specific milestones in the game.

You can test the app [here](https://knd-raidboss-calculator.onrender.com).

## Features

- **Knight Stats Input:**  
  Enter stats for three knights, including attack, defense, HP, element advantage/disadvantage, and stun chance.

- **Boss Configuration:**  
  Choose between Raid Boss and Blitz Boss, select boss level, and set milestone values to tailor the simulation. (Currently only works for Raid boss level 4.)

- **Simulation Results:**  
  Run multiple simulations to calculate:
  - **Average Damage**
  - **Maximum Damage** 
  - **Minimum Damage** 
  - **Energy Required** 
  - **Gems Required** 

## Notes
The app assumes you have a tier 4 SR Pet and that all attacks are special attacks. Also assumes the first 30 energy spent is F2P from milestones / waiting. Gem calculator might estimate 1 more 90 pack than the required.
